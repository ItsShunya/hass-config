This repository contains the complete configuration for my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) installation. It includes all automations, dashboards, scripts, and customizations used to manage and automate devices throughout my home. It is designed for personal use but can serve as a reference for others interested in setting up their HA servers.

Feel free to use parts of this repository, but note that it is tailored to my specific devices and will require adjustments for your use case.
